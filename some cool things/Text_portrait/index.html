        Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907[a] – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic
        Indian revolutionary[6] who participated in the mistaken murder of a
        junior British police officer[7] in what was to be retaliation for the
        death of an Indian nationalist.[8] He later took part in a largely
        symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a
        hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in
        Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab
        region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in
        Northern India.[9] Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and
        anarchism,[10][11][12][13][14] he electrified a growing militancy in
        India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian
        National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for
        India's independence.[15] In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an
        associate, Shivaram Rajguru, both members of a small revolutionary
        group, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (also Army, or
        HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old British police officer, John Saunders, in
        Lahore, Punjab, in what is today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was
        still on probation, for the British senior police superintendent, James
        Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate.[16] They held Scott
        responsible for the death of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala
        Lajpat Rai for having ordered a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was
        injured and two weeks thereafter died of a heart attack. As Saunders
        exited a police station on a motorcycle, he was felled by a single
        bullet fired from across the street by Rajguru, a marksman.[17][18] As
        he lay injured, he was shot at close range several times by Singh, the
        postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds.[19] Another associate of
        Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead an Indian police head constable,
        Channan Singh, who attempted to give chase as Singh and Rajguru
        fled.[17][18] After having escaped, Bhagat Singh and his associates used
        pseudonyms to publicly announce avenging Lajpat Rai's death, putting up
        prepared posters that they had altered to show John Saunders as their
        intended target instead of James Scott.[17] Singh was thereafter on the
        run for many months, and no convictions resulted at the time. Surfacing
        again in April 1929, he and another associate, Batukeshwar Dutt, set off
        two low-intensity homemade bombs among some unoccupied benches of the
        Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi. They showered leaflets from the
        gallery on the legislators below, shouted slogans, and allowed the
        authorities to arrest them.[20] The arrest, and the resulting publicity,
        brought to light Singh's complicity in the John Saunders case. Awaiting
        trial, Singh gained public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant
        Jatin Das in a hunger strike, demanding better prison conditions for
        Indian prisoners, the strike ending in Das's death from starvation in
        September 1929. Bhagat Singh was convicted of the murder of John
        Saunders and Channan Singh, and hanged in March 1931, aged 23. He became
        a popular folk hero after his death. Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him:
        "Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but
        because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala
        Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol; the act
        was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town
        and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of
        northern India, resounded with his name."[21] In still later years,
        Singh, an atheist and socialist in adulthood, won admirers in India from
        among a political spectrum that included both communists and right-wing
        Hindu nationalists. Although many of Singh's associates, as well as many
        Indian anti-colonial revolutionaries, were also involved in daring acts
        and were either executed or died violent deaths, few came to be lionised
        in popular art and literature as did Singh, who is sometimes referred to
        as the Shaheed-e-Azam ("Great martyr" in Urdu and Punjabi).[22] Early
        life Bhagat Singh was born on 27 September 1907[a] in the village of
        Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British
        India and is today Pakistan; he was the second of seven children—four
        sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh
        Sandhu.[23] Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active
        in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around the Canal
        Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of
        1914–1915.[23] After being sent to the village school in Banga for a few
        years, Bhagat Singh was enrolled in the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic School in
        Lahore.[23] In 1923, he joined the National College in Lahore, founded
        two years earlier by Lala Lajpat Rai in response to Mahatma Gandhi's
        non-cooperation movement, which urged Indian students to shun schools
        and colleges subsidized by the British Indian government.[23] Police
        became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him in
        May 1927 on the pretext that he had been involved in a bombing that had
        taken place in Lahore in October 1926. He was released on a surety of
        Rs. 60,000 five weeks after his arrest.[24] He wrote for, and edited,
        Urdu and Punjabi newspapers, published in Amritsar[25] and also
        contributed to low-priced pamphlets published by the Naujawan Bharat
        Sabha that excoriated the British.[26] He also wrote for Kirti, the
        journal of the Kirti Kisan Party ("Workers and Peasants Party") and
        briefly for the Veer Arjun newspaper, published in Delhi.[27][b] He
        often used pseudonyms, including names such as Balwant, Ranjit and
        Vidhrohi.[29] Revolutionary activities Killing of John Saunders In 1928,
        the British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the
        political situation in India. Some Indian political parties boycotted
        the Commission because there were no Indians in its membership,[c] and
        there were protests across the country. When the Commission visited
        Lahore on 30 October 1928, Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest
        against it. Police attempts to disperse the large crowd resulted in
        violence. The superintendent of police, James A. Scott, ordered the
        police to lathi charge (use batons against) the protesters and
        personally assaulted Rai, who was injured. Rai died of a heart attack on
        17 November 1928. Doctors thought that his death might have been
        hastened by the injuries he had received. When the matter was raised in
        the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the British Government denied any
        role in Rai's death.[31][32][33] Singh was a prominent member of the
        Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) and was probably responsible, in
        large part, for its change of name to Hindustan Socialist Republican
        Association (HSRA) in 1928.[34] The HSRA vowed to avenge Rai's
        death.[24] Singh conspired with revolutionaries like Shivaram Rajguru,
        Sukhdev Thapar, and Chandrashekhar Azad to kill Scott.[27] However, in a
        case of mistaken identity, the plotters shot John P. Saunders, an
        Assistant Superintendent of Police, as he was leaving the District
        Police Headquarters in Lahore on 17 December 1928.[35] HSRA pamphlet
        after Saunders' murder, signed by Balraj, a pseudonym of Chandrashekhar
        Azad Contemporary reaction to the killing differs substantially from the
        adulation that later surfaced. The Naujawan Bharat Sabha, which had
        organised the Lahore protest march along with the HSRA, found that
        attendance at its subsequent public meetings dropped sharply.
        Politicians, activists, and newspapers, including The People, which Rai
        had founded in 1925, stressed that non-co-operation was preferable to
        violence.[30] The murder was condemned as a retrograde action by Mahatma
        Gandhi, the Congress leader, but Jawaharlal Nehru later wrote that:
        Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but
        because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala
        Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol, the act
        was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town
        and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of
        northern India, resounded with his name. Innumerable songs grew about
        him and the popularity that the man achieved was something amazing.[36]
        Killing of Channan Singh After killing Saunders, the group escaped
        through the D.A.V. College entrance, across the road from the District
        Police Headquarters. Chanan Singh, a Head Constable who was chasing
        them, was shot dead by Chandrashekhar Azad.[37] They then fled on
        bicycles to pre-arranged safe houses. The police launched a massive
        search operation to catch them, blocking all entrances and exits to and
        from the city; the CID kept a watch on all young men leaving Lahore. The
        fugitives hid for the next two days. On 19 December 1928, Sukhdev called
        on Durgawati Devi, sometimes known as Durga Bhabhi, wife of another HSRA
        member, Bhagwati Charan Vohra, for help, which she agreed to provide.
        They decided to catch the train departing from Lahore to Bathinda en
        route to Howrah (Calcutta) early the next morning.[38] Escape from
        Lahore Bhagat Singh and Rajguru, both carrying loaded revolvers, left
        the house early the next day.[38] Dressed in western attire (Bhagat
        Singh cut his hair, shaved his beard and wore a hat over cropped hair),
        and carrying Devi's sleeping child, Singh and Devi passed as a young
        couple, while Rajguru carried their luggage as their servant. At the
        station, Singh managed to conceal his identity while buying tickets, and
        the three boarded the train heading to Cawnpore (now Kanpur). There they
        boarded a train for Lucknow since the CID at Howrah railway station
        usually scrutinised passengers on the direct train from Lahore.[38] At
        Lucknow, Rajguru left separately for Benares while Singh, Devi and the
        infant went to Howrah, with all except Singh returning to Lahore a few
        days later.[39][38] Delhi Assembly bombing and arrest For some time,
        Bhagat Singh had been exploiting the power of drama as a means to
        inspire the revolt against the British, purchasing a magic lantern to
        show slides that enlivened his talks about revolutionaries such as Ram
        Prasad Bismil who had died as a result of the Kakori conspiracy. In
        1929, he proposed a dramatic act to the HSRA intended to gain massive
        publicity for their aims.[26] Influenced by Auguste Vaillant, a French
        anarchist who had bombed the Chamber of Deputies in Paris,[40] Singh's
        plan was to explode a bomb inside the Central Legislative Assembly. The
        nominal intention was to protest against the Public Safety Bill, and the
        Trade Dispute Act, which had been rejected by the Assembly but were
        being enacted by the Viceroy using his special powers; the actual
        intention was for the perpetrators to allow themselves to be arrested so
        that they could use court appearances as a stage to publicise their
        cause.[29] The HSRA leadership was initially opposed to Bhagat's
        participation in the bombing because they were certain that his prior
        involvement in the Saunders shooting meant that his arrest would
        ultimately result in his execution. However, they eventually decided
        that he was their most suitable candidate. On 8 April 1929, Singh,
        accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into the Assembly
        chamber from its public gallery while it was in session.[41] The bombs
        had been designed not to kill,[30] but some members, including George
        Ernest Schuster, the finance member of the Viceroy's Executive Council,
        were injured.[42] The smoke from the bombs filled the Assembly so that
        Singh and Dutt could probably have escaped in the confusion had they
        wished. Instead, they stayed shouting the slogan "Inquilab Zindabad!"
        ("Long Live the Revolution") and threw leaflets. The two men were
        arrested and subsequently moved through a series of jails in Delhi.[43]
        Assembly case trial According to Neeti Nair, associate professor of
        history, "public criticism of this terrorist action was
        unequivocal."[30] Gandhi, once again, issued strong words of disapproval
        of their deed.[21] Nonetheless, the jailed Bhagat was reported to be
        elated, and referred to the subsequent legal proceedings as a
        "drama".[43] Singh and Dutt eventually responded to the criticism by
        writing the Assembly Bomb Statement: We hold human life sacred beyond
        words. We are neither perpetrators of dastardly outrages ... nor are we
        'lunatics' as the Tribune of Lahore and some others would have it
        believed ... Force when aggressively applied is 'violence' and is,
        therefore, morally unjustifiable, but when it is used in the furtherance
        of a legitimate cause, it has its moral justification.[30] The trial
        began in the first week of June, following a preliminary hearing in May.
        On 12 June, both men were sentenced to life imprisonment for: "causing
        explosions of a nature likely to endanger life, unlawfully and
        maliciously."[43][44] Dutt had been defended by Asaf Ali, while Singh
        defended himself.[45] Doubts have been raised about the accuracy of
        testimony offered at the trial. One key discrepancy concerns the
        automatic pistol that Singh had been carrying when he was arrested. Some
        witnesses said that he had fired two or three shots while the police
        sergeant who arrested him testified that the gun was pointed downward
        when he took it from him and that Singh "was playing with it."[46]
        According to an article in the India Law Journal, the prosecution
        witnesses were coached, their accounts were incorrect, and Singh had
        turned over the pistol himself.[47] Singh was given a life sentence.[48]
        Arrest of associates In 1929, the HSRA had set up bomb factories in
        Lahore and Saharanpur. On 15 April 1929, the Lahore bomb factory was
        discovered by the police, leading to the arrest of other members of
        HSRA, including Sukhdev, Kishori Lal, and Jai Gopal. Not long after
        this, the Saharanpur factory was also raided and some of the
        conspirators became informants. With the new information available, the
        police were able to connect the three strands of the Saunders murder,
        Assembly bombing, and bomb manufacture.[33] Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, and
        21 others were charged with the Saunders murder.[49] Hunger strike and
        Lahore conspiracy case Singh was re-arrested for murdering Saunders and
        Chanan Singh based on substantial evidence against him, including
        statements by his associates, Hans Raj Vohra and Jai Gopal.[47] His life
        sentence in the Assembly Bomb case was deferred until the Saunders case
        was decided.[48] He was sent to Central Jail Mianwali from the Delhi
        jail.[45] There he witnessed discrimination between European and Indian
        prisoners. He considered himself, along with others, to be a political
        prisoner. He noted that he had received an enhanced diet at Delhi which
        was not being provided at Mianwali. He led other Indian, self-identified
        political prisoners he felt were being treated as common criminals in a
        hunger strike. They demanded equality in food standards, clothing,
        toiletries, and other hygienic necessities, as well as access to books
        and a daily newspaper. They argued that they should not be forced to do
        manual labour or any undignified work in the jail.[50][30] Hunger strike
        poster of Bhagat Singh and Batukeshswar Dutt The hunger strike inspired
        a rise in public support for Singh and his colleagues from around June
        1929. The Tribune newspaper was particularly prominent in this movement
        and reported on mass meetings in places such as Lahore and Amritsar. The
        government had to apply Section 144 of the criminal code in an attempt
        to limit gatherings.[30] Daily milap poster of the Lahore conspiracy
        case 1930.Death sentence of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
        Jawaharlal Nehru met Singh and the other strikers in Central Jail
        Mianwali. After the meeting, he stated: I was very much pained to see
        the distress of the heroes. They have staked their lives in this
        struggle. They want that political prisoners should be treated as
        political prisoners. I am quite hopeful that their sacrifice would be
        crowned with success.[51] Muhammad Ali Jinnah spoke in support of the
        strikers in the Assembly, saying: The man who goes on hunger strike has
        a soul. He is moved by that soul, and he believes in the justice of his
        cause ... however much you deplore them and, however, much you say they
        are misguided, it is the system, this damnable system of governance,
        which is resented by the people.[52] The government tried to break the
        strike by placing different food items in the prison cells to test the
        prisoners' resolve. Water pitchers were filled with milk so that either
        the prisoners remained thirsty or broke their strike; nobody faltered
        and the impasse continued. The authorities then attempted force-feeding
        the prisoners but this was resisted.[53][d] With the matter still
        unresolved, the Indian Viceroy, Lord Irwin, cut short his vacation in
        Simla to discuss the situation with jail authorities.[55] Since the
        activities of the hunger strikers had gained popularity and attention
        amongst the people nationwide, the government decided to advance the
        start of the Saunders murder trial, which was henceforth called the
        Lahore Conspiracy Case. Singh was transported to Borstal Jail,
        Lahore,[56] and the trial began there on 10 July 1929. In addition to
        charging them with the murder of Saunders, Singh and the 27 other
        prisoners were charged with plotting a conspiracy to murder Scott, and
        waging a war against the King.[47] Singh, still on hunger strike, had to
        be carried to the court handcuffed on a stretcher; he had lost 14 pounds
        (6.4 kg) from his original weight of 133 pounds (60 kg) since beginning
        the strike.[56] The government was beginning to make concessions but
        refused to move on the core issue of recognising the classification of
        "political prisoner". In the eyes of officials, if someone broke the law
        then that was a personal act, not a political one, and they were common
        criminals.[30] By now, the condition of another hunger striker, Jatindra
        Nath Das, lodged in the same jail, had deteriorated considerably. The
        Jail committee recommended his unconditional release, but the government
        rejected the suggestion and offered to release him on bail. On 13
        September 1929, Das died after a 63-day hunger strike.[56] Almost all
        the nationalist leaders in the country paid tribute to Das' death.
        Mohammad Alam and Gopi Chand Bhargava resigned from the Punjab
        Legislative Council in protest, and Nehru moved a successful adjournment
        motion in the Central Assembly as a censure against the "inhumane
        treatment" of the Lahore prisoners.[57] Singh finally heeded a
        resolution of the Congress party, and a request by his father, ending
        his hunger strike on 5 October 1929 after 116 days.[47] During this
        period, Singh's popularity among common Indians extended beyond
        Punjab.[30][58] Singh's attention now turned to his trial, where he was
        to face a Crown prosecution team comprising C. H. Carden-Noad, Kalandar
        Ali Khan, Jai Gopal Lal, and the prosecuting inspector, Bakshi Dina
        Nath.[47] The defence was composed of eight lawyers. Prem Dutt Verma,
        the youngest amongst the 27 accused, threw his slipper at Gopal when he
        turned and became a prosecution witness in court. As a result, the
        magistrate ordered that all the accused should be handcuffed.[47] Singh
        and others refused to be handcuffed and were subjected to brutal
        beating.[59] The revolutionaries refused to attend the court and Singh
        wrote a letter to the magistrate citing various reasons for their
        refusal.[60][61] The magistrate ordered the trial to proceed without the
        accused or members of the HSRA. This was a setback for Singh as he could
        no longer use the trial as a forum to publicise his views.[62] Special
        Tribunal To speed up the slow trial, the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, declared
        an emergency on 1 May 1930 and introduced an ordinance to set up a
        special tribunal composed of three high court judges for the case. This
        decision cut short the normal process of justice as the only appeal
        after the tribunal was to the Privy Council located in England.[47] On 2
        July 1930, a habeas corpus petition was filed in the High Court
        challenging the ordinance on the grounds that it was ultra vires and,
        therefore, illegal; the Viceroy had no powers to shorten the customary
        process of determining justice.[47] The petition argued that the Defence
        of India Act 1915 allowed the Viceroy to introduce an ordinance, and set
        up such a tribunal, only under conditions of a breakdown of
        law-and-order, which, it was claimed in this case, had not occurred.
        However, the petition was dismissed as being premature.[63] Carden-Noad
        presented the government's charges of conducting robberies, and the
        illegal acquisition of arms and ammunition among others.[47] The
        evidence of G. T. H. Hamilton Harding, the Lahore superintendent of
        police, shocked the court. He stated that he had filed the first
        information report against the accused under specific orders from the
        chief secretary to the governor of Punjab and that he was unaware of the
        details of the case. The prosecution depended mainly on the evidence of
        P. N. Ghosh, Hans Raj Vohra, and Jai Gopal who had been Singh's
        associates in the HSRA. On 10 July 1930, the tribunal decided to press
        charges against only 15 of the 18 accused and allowed their petitions to
        be taken up for hearing the next day. The trial ended on 30 September
        1930.[47] The three accused, whose charges were withdrawn, included Dutt
        who had already been given a life sentence in the Assembly bomb
        case.[64] The ordinance (and the tribunal) would lapse on 31 October
        1930 as it had not been passed by the Central Assembly or the British
        Parliament. On 7 October 1930, the tribunal delivered its 300-page
        judgement based on all the evidence and concluded that the participation
        of Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru in Saunder's murder was proven. They were
        sentenced to death by hanging.[47] Of the other accused, three were
        acquitted (Ajoy Ghosh, Jatindra Nath Sanyal and Des Raj), Kundan Lal
        received seven years' rigorous imprisonment, Prem Dutt received five
        years of the same, and the remaining seven (Kishori Lal, Mahabir Singh,
        Bijoy Kumar Sinha, Shiv Verma, Gaya Prasad, Jai Dev and Kamalnath
        Tewari) were all sentenced to transportation for life.[65] Appeal to the
        Privy Council In Punjab province, a defence committee drew up a plan to
        appeal to the Privy Council. Singh was initially against the appeal but
        later agreed to it in the hope that the appeal would popularise the HSRA
        in Britain. The appellants claimed that the ordinance which created the
        tribunal was invalid while the government countered that the Viceroy was
        completely empowered to create such a tribunal. The appeal was dismissed
        by Judge Viscount Dunedin.[66] Reactions to the judgement After the
        rejection of the appeal to the Privy Council, Congress party president
        Madan Mohan Malaviya filed a mercy appeal before Irwin on 14 February
        1931.[67] Some prisoners sent Mahatma Gandhi an appeal to intervene.[47]
        In his notes dated 19 March 1931, the Viceroy recorded: While returning
        Gandhiji asked me if he could talk about the case of Bhagat Singh
        because newspapers had come out with the news of his slated hanging on
        March 24th. It would be a very unfortunate day because on that day the
        new president of the Congress had to reach Karachi and there would be a
        lot of hot discussion. I explained to him that I had given a very
        careful thought to it but I did not find any basis to convince myself to
        commute the sentence. It appeared he found my reasoning weighty.[68] The
        Communist Party of Great Britain expressed its reaction to the case: The
        history of this case, of which we do not come across any example in
        relation to the political cases, reflects the symptoms of callousness
        and cruelty which is the outcome of bloated desire of the imperialist
        government of Britain so that fear can be instilled in the hearts of the
        repressed people.[67] A plan to rescue Singh and fellow HSRA inmates
        from the jail failed. HSRA member Durga Devi's husband, Bhagwati Charan
        Vohra, attempted to manufacture bombs for the purpose, but died when
        they exploded accidentally.[69] Execution Death certificate of Bhagat
        Singh Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were sentenced to death in the Lahore
        conspiracy case and ordered to be hanged on 24 March 1931.[70] The
        schedule was moved forward by 11 hours and the three were hanged on 23
        March 1931 at 7:30 pm[71] in the Lahore jail. It is reported that no
        magistrate at the time was willing to supervise Singh's hanging as was
        required by law. The execution was supervised instead by an honorary
        judge, who also signed the three death warrants, as their original
        warrants had expired.[72] The jail authorities then broke a hole in the
        rear wall of the jail, removed the bodies, and secretly cremated the
        three men under cover of darkness outside Ganda Singh Wala village, and
        then threw the ashes into the Sutlej river, about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi)
        from Ferozepore.[73] Criticism of the tribunal trial Singh's trial has
        been described by the Supreme Court as "contrary to the fundamental
        doctrine of criminal jurisprudence" because there was no opportunity for
        the accused to defend themselves.[74] The Special Tribunal was a
        departure from the normal procedure adopted for a trial and its decision
        could only be appealed to the Privy Council located in Britain.[47] The
        accused were absent from the court and the judgement was passed
        ex-parte.[62] The ordinance, which was introduced by the Viceroy to form
        the Special Tribunal, was never approved by the Central Assembly or the
        British Parliament, and it eventually lapsed without any legal or
        constitutional sanctity.[59] Reactions to the executions The Tribune
        news report of Sardar Bhagat Singh's execution,1931. The executions were
        reported widely by the press, especially as they took place on the eve
        of the annual convention of the Congress party at Karachi.[75] Gandhi
        faced black flag demonstrations by angry youths who shouted "Down with
        Gandhi".[76] The New York Times reported: A reign of terror in the city
        of Cawnpore in the United Provinces and an attack on Mahatma Gandhi by a
        youth outside Karachi were among the answers of the Indian extremists
        today to the hanging of Bhagat Singh and two fellow-assassins.[77]
        Hartals and strikes of mourning were called.[78] The Congress party,
        during the Karachi session, declared: While dissociating itself from and
        disapproving of political violence in any shape or form, this Congress
        places on record its admiration of the bravery and sacrifice of Bhagat
        Singh, Sukh Dev and Raj Guru and mourns with their bereaved families the
        loss of these lives. The Congress is of the opinion that their triple
        execution was an act of wanton vengeance and a deliberate flouting of
        the unanimous demand of the nation for commutation. This Congress is
        further of the opinion that the [British] Government lost a golden
        opportunity for promoting good-will between the two nations, admittedly
        held to be crucial at this juncture, and for winning over to methods of
        peace a party which, driven to despair, resorts to political
        violence.[79] In the issue of Young India of 29 March 1931, Gandhi
        wrote: Bhagat Singh and his two associates have been hanged. The
        Congress made many attempts to save their lives and the Government
        entertained many hopes of it, but all has been in a vain. Bhagat Singh
        did not wish to live. He refused to apologise, or even file an appeal.
        Bhagat Singh was not a devotee of non-violence, but he did not subscribe
        to the religion of violence. He took to violence due to helplessness and
        to defend his homeland. In his last letter, Bhagat Singh wrote, " I have
        been arrested while waging a war. For me there can be no gallows. Put me
        into the mouth of a cannon and blow me off." These heroes had conquered
        the fear of death. Let us bow to them a thousand times for their
        heroism. But we should not imitate their act. In our land of millions of
        destitute and crippled people, if we take to the practice of seeking
        justice through murder, there will be a terrifying situation. Our poor
        people will become victims of our atrocities. By making a dharma of
        violence, we shall be reaping the fruit of our own actions. Hence,
        though we praise the courage of these brave men, we should never
        countenance their activities. Our dharma is to swallow our anger, abide
        by the discipline of non-violence and carry out our duty.[80] Gandhi's
        role On March 23, Mahatama Gandhi had written letter to viceroy in which
        he appealed for commutation for the death sentences against Bhagat
        Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.[81] However, There have been unfounded
        claims that Gandhi had an opportunity to stop Singh's execution. In
        contrast, it is held that Gandhi did not have enough influence with the
        British to stop the execution, much less arrange it,[82] but that he did
        his best to save Singh's life.[83] Gandhi supporters assert that Singh's
        role in the independence movement was no threat to Gandhi's role as its
        leader, so he would have no reason to want him dead.[32] Gandhi always
        maintained that he was a great admirer of Singh's patriotism. He also
        stated that he was opposed to Singh's execution (and for that matter,
        capital punishment in general) and proclaimed that he had no power to
        stop it.[82] Of Singh's execution Gandhi said: "The government certainly
        had the right to hang these men. However, there are some rights which do
        credit to those who possess them only if they are enjoyed in name
        only."[84] Gandhi also once remarked about capital punishment: "I cannot
        in all conscience agree to anyone being sent to the gallows. God alone
        can take life, because he alone gives it."[85] Gandhi had managed to
        have 90,000 political prisoners, who were not members of his Satyagraha
        movement, released under the Gandhi–Irwin Pact.[32] According to a
        report in the Indian magazine Frontline, he did plead several times for
        the commutation of the death sentences of Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev,
        including a personal visit on 19 March 1931. In a letter to the Viceroy
        on the day of their execution, he pleaded fervently for commutation, not
        knowing that the letter would arrive too late.[32] Lord Irwin, the
        Viceroy, later said: As I listened to Mr. Gandhi putting the case for
        commutation before me, I reflected first on what significance it surely
        was that the apostle of non-violence should so earnestly be pleading the
        cause of the devotees of a creed so fundamentally opposed to his own,
        but I should regard it as wholly wrong to allow my judgement to be
        influenced by purely political considerations. I could not imagine a
        case in which under the law, penalty had been more directly
        deserved.[32] Ideals and opinions Communism Singh regarded Kartar Singh
        Sarabha, the founding-member of the Ghadar Party as his hero. Bhagat was
        also inspired by Bhai Parmanand, another founding-member of the Ghadar
        Party.[86] Singh was attracted to anarchism and communism.[87] He was an
        avid reader of the teachings of Mikhail Bakunin and also read Karl Marx,
        Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky.[88] In his last testament, "To Young
        Political Workers", he declares his ideal as the "Social reconstruction
        on new, i.e., Marxist, basis".[89] Singh did not believe in the Gandhian
        ideology – which advocated Satyagraha and other forms of non-violent
        resistance, and felt that such politics would replace one set of
        exploiters with another.[90] From May to September 1928, Singh published
        a series of articles on anarchism in Kirti. He was concerned that the
        public misunderstood the concept of anarchism, writing that: "The people
        are scared of the word anarchism. The word anarchism has been abused so
        much that even in India revolutionaries have been called anarchist to
        make them unpopular." He clarified that anarchism refers to the absence
        of a ruler and abolition of the state, not the absence of order. He went
        on to say: "I think in India the idea of universal brotherhood, the
        Sanskrit sentence Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam etc., has the same meaning." He
        believed that: The ultimate goal of Anarchism is complete independence,
        according to which no one will be obsessed with God or religion, nor
        will anybody be crazy for money or other worldly desires. There will be
        no chains on the body or control by the state. This means that they want
        to eliminate: the Church, God and Religion; the state; Private
        property.[87] On 21 January 1930, during the trial of the Lahore
        Conspiracy Case, Bhagat Singh and his HSRA comrades, appeared in the
        court wearing red scarves. When the magistrate took his chair, they
        raised slogans "Long Live Socialist Revolution", "Long Live Communist
        International", "Long Live People" "Lenin's Name Will Never Die", and
        "Down with Imperialism".[91] Bhagat Singh then read the text of a
        telegram in the court and asked the magistrate to send it to the Third
        International. The telegram stated: "On Lenin day we send harty
        greetings to all who are doing something for carrying forward the ideas
        of the great Lenin. We wish success to the great experiment Russia is
        carrying out. We join our voice to that of the international working
        class movement. The proletariat will win. Capitalism will be defeated.
        Death to Imperialism".[91] Historian K. N. Panikkar described Singh as
        one of the early Marxists in India.[90] The political theorist Jason
        Adams notes that he was more enamoured with Lenin than with Marx.[88]
        From 1926 onward, he studied the history of the revolutionary movements
        in India and abroad. In his prison notebooks, he quoted Lenin in
        reference to imperialism and capitalism and also the revolutionary
        thoughts of Trotsky.[92] On the day his execution, Bhagat Singh was
        reading the book, Reminiscences of Lenin, authored by Clara Zetkin, a
        German Marxist.[93][91] When asked what his last wish was, Singh replied
        that he was studying the life of Lenin and he wanted to finish it before
        his death.[94] Atheism Singh began to question religious ideologies
        after witnessing the Hindu–Muslim riots that broke out after Gandhi
        disbanded the Non-Cooperation Movement. He did not understand how
        members of these two groups, initially united in fighting against the
        British, could be at each other's throats because of their religious
        differences.[95] At this point, Singh dropped his religious beliefs,
        since he believed religion hindered the revolutionaries' struggle for
        independence, and began studying the works of Bakunin, Lenin, Trotsky –
        all atheist revolutionaries. He also took an interest in Soham Swami's
        book Common Sense.[e][96] While in prison in 1930–31, Bhagat Singh was
        approached by Randhir Singh, a fellow inmate, and a Sikh leader who
        would later found the Akhand Kirtani Jatha. According to Bhagat Singh's
        close associate Shiva Verma, who later compiled and edited his writings,
        Randhir Singh tried to convince Bhagat Singh of the existence of God,
        and upon failing berated him: "You are giddy with fame and have
        developed an ego that is standing like a black curtain between you and
        God".[97][f] In response, Bhagat Singh wrote an essay entitled "Why I Am
        an Atheist" to address the question of whether his atheism was born out
        of vanity. In the essay, he defended his own beliefs and said that he
        used to be a firm believer in the Almighty, but could not bring himself
        to believe the myths and beliefs that others held close to their
        hearts.[99] He acknowledged the fact that religion made death easier,
        but also said that unproven philosophy is a sign of human weakness.[97]
        In this context, he noted: As regard the origin of God, my thought is
        that man created God in his imagination when he realised his weaknesses,
        limitations and shortcomings. In this way he got the courage to face all
        the trying circumstances and to meet all dangers that might occur in his
        life and also to restrain his outbursts in prosperity and affluence.
        God, with his whimsical laws and parental generosity was painted with
        variegated colours of imagination. He was used as a deterrent factor
        when his fury and his laws were repeatedly propagated so that man might
        not become a danger to society. He was the cry of the distressed soul
        for he was believed to stand as father and mother, sister and brother,
        brother and friend when in time of distress a man was left alone and
        helpless. He was Almighty and could do anything. The idea of God is
        helpful to a man in distress.[97] Towards the end of the essay, Bhagat
        Singh wrote: Let us see how steadfast I am. One of my friends asked me
        to pray. When informed of my atheism, he said, "When your last days
        come, you will begin to believe." I said, "No, dear sir, Never shall it
        happen. I consider it to be an act of degradation and demoralisation.
        For such petty selfish motives, I shall never pray." Reader and friends,
        is it vanity? If it is, I stand for it.[97] "Killing the ideas" In the
        leaflet he threw in the Central Assembly on 8 April 1929, he stated: "It
        is easy to kill individuals but you cannot kill the ideas. Great empires
        crumbled, while the ideas survived."[100] While in prison, Singh and two
        others had written a letter to Lord Irwin, wherein they asked to be
        treated as prisoners of war and consequently to be executed by firing
        squad and not by hanging.[101] Prannath Mehta, Singh's friend, visited
        him in the jail on 20 March, three days before his execution, with a
        draft letter for clemency, but he declined to sign it.[32] Reception
        Singh was criticised both by his contemporaries,[who?] and by people
        after his death,[who?] for his violent and revolutionary stance towards
        the British as well as his strong opposition to the pacifist stance
        taken by Gandhi and the Indian National Congress.[102][103] The methods
        he used to convey his message, such as shooting Saunders, and throwing
        non-lethal bombs, stood in stark contrast to Gandhi's non-violent
        methodology,[103] however Gandhi condemned the act of violence but he
        still considered him to be a great patriot and martyr. Popularity Wall
        painting of Singh, Rewalsar, Himachal Pradesh. Subhas Chandra Bose said
        that: "Bhagat Singh had become the symbol of the new awakening among the
        youths." Nehru acknowledged that Bhagat Singh's popularity was leading
        to a new national awakening, saying: "He was a clean fighter who faced
        his enemy in the open field ... he was like a spark that became a flame
        in a short time and spread from one end of the country to the other
        dispelling the prevailing darkness everywhere".[76] Four years after
        Singh's hanging, the Director of the Intelligence Bureau, Sir Horace
        Williamson, wrote: "His photograph was on sale in every city and
        township and for a time rivaled in popularity even that of Mr. Gandhi
        himself".[76] See also Udham Singh Kartar Singh Sarabha Harnam Singh

        India, in New Delhi on 15 August 2008. Singh on a 1968 stamp of India
        Bhagat Singh remains a significant figure in Indian iconography to the
        present day.[104] His memory, however, defies categorisation and
        presents problems for various groups that might try to appropriate it.
        Pritam Singh, a professor who has specialised in the study of
        federalism, nationalism and development in India, notes that Bhagat
        Singh represents a challenge to almost every tendency in Indian
        politics. Gandhi-inspired Indian nationalists, Hindu nationalists, Sikh
        nationalists, the parliamentary Left and the pro-armed struggle Naxalite
        Left compete with each other to appropriate the legacy of Bhagat Singh,
        and yet each one of them is faced with a contradiction in making a claim
        to his legacy. Gandhi-inspired Indian nationalists find Bhagat Singh's
        resort to violence problematic, the Hindu and Sikh nationalists find his
        atheism troubling, the parliamentary Left finds his ideas and actions as
        more close to the perspective of the Naxalites and the Naxalites find
        Bhagat Singh's critique of individual terrorism in his later life an
        uncomfortable historical fact.[105] On 15 August 2008, an 18-foot tall
        bronze statue of Singh was installed in the Parliament of India, next to
        the statues of Indira Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose.[106] A portrait of
        Singh and Dutt also adorns the walls of the Parliament House.[107] The
        National Martyrs Memorial, built at Hussainiwala in memory of Bhagat
        Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru The place where Singh was cremated, at
        Hussainiwala on the banks of the Sutlej river, became Pakistani
        territory during the partition. On 17 January 1961, it was transferred
        to India in exchange for 12 villages near the Sulemanki Headworks.[73]
        Batukeshwar Dutt was cremated there on 19 July 1965 in accordance with
        his last wishes, as was Singh's mother, Vidyawati.[108] The National
        Martyrs Memorial was built on the cremation spot in 1968[109] and has
        memorials of Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev. During the 1971 India–Pakistan
        war, the memorial was damaged and the statues of the martyrs were
        removed by the Pakistani Army. They have not been returned[73][110] but
        the memorial was rebuilt in 1973.[108] The Shaheedi Mela (Punjabi:
        Martyrdom Fair) is an event held annually on 23 March when people pay
        homage at the National Martyrs Memorial.[111] The day is also observed
        across the Indian state of Punjab.[112] The Shaheed-e-Azam Sardar Bhagat
        Singh Museum opened on the 50th anniversary of his death at his
        ancestral village, Khatkar Kalan. Exhibits include Singh's ashes, the
        blood-soaked sand, and the blood-stained newspaper in which the ashes
        were wrapped.[113] A page of the first Lahore Conspiracy Case's
        judgement in which Kartar Singh Sarabha was sentenced to death and on
        which Singh put some notes is also displayed,[113] as well as a copy of
        the Bhagavad Gita with Bhagat Singh's signature, which was given to him
        in the Lahore Jail, and other personal belongings.[114][115] The Bhagat
        Singh Memorial was built in 2009 in Khatkar Kalan at a cost of ₹168
        million (US$2.1 million).[116] The Supreme Court of India established a
        museum to display landmarks in the history of India's judicial system,
        displaying records of some historic trials. The first exhibition that
        was organised was the Trial of Bhagat Singh, which opened on 28
        September 2007, on the centenary celebrations of Singh's birth.[74][59]
        Modern days Statues of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev at the
        India–Pakistan Border, near Hussainiwala The youth of India still draw
        tremendous amount of inspiration from Singh.[117][118][119] He was voted
        the "Greatest Indian" in a poll by the Indian magazine India Today in
        2008, ahead of Bose and Gandhi.[120] During the centenary of his birth,
        a group of intellectuals set up an institution named Bhagat Singh
        Sansthan to commemorate him and his ideals.[121] The Parliament of India
        paid tributes and observed silence as a mark of respect in memory of
        Singh on 23 March 2001[122] and 2005.[123] In Pakistan, after a
        long-standing demand by activists from the Bhagat Singh Memorial
        Foundation of Pakistan, the Shadman Chowk square in Lahore, where he was
        hanged, was renamed as Bhagat Singh Chowk. This change was successfully
        challenged in a Pakistani court.[124][125] On 6 September 2015, the
        Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation filed a petition in the Lahore high
        court and again demanded the renaming of the Chowk to Bhagat Singh
        Chowk.[126] Films and television Several films have been made portraying
        the life and times of Singh. The first film based on his life was
        Shaheed-e-Azad Bhagat Singh (1954) in which Prem Adeeb played the role
        of Singh followed by Shaheed Bhagat Singh (1963), starring Shammi Kapoor
        as Bhagat Singh, Shaheed (1965) in which Manoj Kumar portrayed Bhagat
        Singh and Amar Shaheed Bhagat Singh (1974) in which Som Dutt portrays
        Singh. Three films about Singh were released in 2002 Shaheed-E-Azam, 23
        March 1931: Shaheed and The Legend of Bhagat Singh in which Singh was
        portrayed by Sonu Sood, Bobby Deol and Ajay Devgn
        respectively.[127][128] Bhagat Singh (2002), a drama film directed by
        Anand Sagar and written/produced Ramanand Sagar was aired on DD
        National. It featured Deepak Dutta in the titular role.[129] Siddharth
        played the role of Bhagat Singh in the 2006 film Rang De Basanti, a film
        drawing parallels between revolutionaries of Bhagat Singh's era and
        modern Indian youth.[130] Another similar approach was taken in the
        independent film, among others, Shaheed-E-Aazam (2018) where Rahul
        Pathak played the lead role. Gurdas Mann played the role of Singh in
        Shaheed Udham Singh, a film based on life of Udham Singh while Amol
        Parashar portrayed Singh in Sardar Udham, another film based on Udham
        Singh's life.[131] Karam Rajpal portrayed Bhagat Singh in Star Bharat's
        television series Chandrashekhar, which is based on life of Chandra
        Shekhar Azad.[132] In 2008, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) and
        Act Now for Harmony and Democracy (ANHAD), a non-profit organisation,
        co-produced a 40-minute documentary on Bhagat Singh entitled Inqilab,
        directed by Gauhar Raza.[133][134] Theatre Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru
        have been the inspiration for a number of plays in India and Pakistan,
        that continue to attract crowds.[135][136][137] Songs Although, the
        patriotic Hindustani songs, "Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna" ("The desire to
        sacrifice") created by Bismil Azimabadi,[138] and "Mera Rang De Basanti
        Chola" ("O Mother! Dye my robe the colour of spring") created by Ram
        Prasad Bismil,[139] are largely associated with Singh and have been used
        in a number of related films.[140] Other In 1968, a postage stamp was

        The majority of reliable sources state Bhagat Singh was born on 27
        September 1907;[1] a few mention 28 September 1907.[2][3] An early
        biography by Sanyal, considered the date to be 19 October 1907.[4] He
        was secretary of the Kirti Kisan Party when it organised an all-India
        meeting of revolutionaries in September 1928 and he later became its
        leader.[28] Opposition in India to the Simon Commission was not
        universal. For example, the Central Sikh League, some Hindu politicians,
        and some members of the Muslim League agreed to co-operate[30] An
        example of the methods adopted to counterattack attempts at
        force-feeding is the swallowing of red pepper and boiling water by a
        prisoner called Kishori Lal. This combination made his throat too sore
        to permit entry of the feeding tube.[54] Singh incorrectly referred to
        Niralamba Swami as the author of the book, however Niralamba had only
        written the introduction. In his own account of the meeting though,
        Randhir Singh says that Bhagat Singh repented for giving up his religion
        and said that he did so only under the influence of irreligious people
        and in search of personal glory. Certain Sikh groups periodically
        attempt to reclaim Bhagat Singh as a Sikh based on Randhir Singh's
        writings.[98] Citations Deol, Jeevan Singh (2004). "Singh, Bhagat [known

        Google. This day is also the birthday of well-known and respected Indian
        freedom fighter Bhagat Singh, though some claim 28 September to be his
        birthday. For all the years after Indian independence, Bhagat Singh's
        birthday was what the Indian media remembered on 27 September, with the
        union government's Directorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity
        (DAVP) issuing large eulogising display advertisements ahead of the day,
        reminding the nation of the day's significance in the Indian
        independence movement and nation-building. But by the turn of the
        twenty-first century, amidst the excitement of changes brought about by
        the liberalisation of the Indian economy and its consequent growing
        integration with the global market, all major Indian news channels and
        newspapers began enthusiastically remembering Google, carrying features
        on this phenomenon of the digital age for days, and in the process,
        virtually marginalised the memory of Bhagat Singh to the periphery of
        the media's, and therefore, the public's consciousness.2 Obviously, the
        paradigms of history writing are yet getting set for another revolution.
        If history is the story of the state, as Carr suggested, then history
        telling must also have to change with the transformation the nature of
        modern States is going through. Noorani, A. G. (2001), The Trial of

        978-0-19-876934-7, Congress was often split on the question of the
        extent to which all protests should be non-violent. Gandhi, though
        highly influential, had opponents. It is particularly important to
        recognize the existence of a socialist, radical wing within the
        nationalist movement. Historians often discuss this wing with reference
        to Bhagat Singh, a charismatic Indian revolutionary executed by the
        British with two other revolutionaries in 1931 for murdering a British
        police officer. Chenoy, Kamal Mitra (2021), "Russian Revolution and the

        other progressive movements inspired by the Russian Revolution. Most
        popular and well known among them were the Hindustan Socialist
        Revolutionary Army established in 1928, whose charismatic leader Bhagat

        One month after Lajpat Rai's death, at 4:30 pm on 17 December 1928,
        members of the HSRA ambushed Assistant Superintendent of Police J. P.
        Saunders as he was leaving the police station on Lahore's College Road.
        He was shot once by Shivaram Rajguru, and then again by Bhagat Singh."
        As the two fled through the gates of the DAV College located opposite
        the station, their comrade Chandrashekhar Azad fired at the pursuing
        officer, Constable Chanan Singh. Both Singh and Saunders died from their
        wounds. Amid the chaos, there was some room for farce. Saunders was not
        the primary target; the HSRA's Jaigopal mistook the assistant for his
        boss, Mr. Scott, the man who had ordered police to charge the Simon
        Commission protestors two months earlier. Once it was clear this was a
        subordinate and not Scott, the revolutionaries scrambled to amend
        posters prepared in advance to announce the act. Vaidik, Aparna (2021),
        Waiting for Swaraj: Inner Lives of Indian Revolutionaires, Cambridge
        University Press, p. 121, ISBN 978-1-00-903238-4, The memoirs poignantly
        recount how they would be filled with agony and remorse after the
        assassinations and the deaths of the innocent. For instance, Azad shot
        the Indian constable Chanan Singh, who had chased Bhagat and Rajguru as
        they escaped through the DAV College after shooting Saunders. Azad was
        standing guard a few metres away from Bhagat and Rajguru supervising the
        operation and, if needed, was supposed to give them cover. Azad called
        out to Chanan Singh to give up the chase before shooting but Chanan did
        not heed the warning and kept running. Azad lowered his gun and aimed at
        his legs and shot a preventive bullet. It got Chanan in the groin and he
        eventually bled to death. The well-being of Chanan Singh's family kept
        nagging Azad, who would voice his worries time and again to his
        associates. Vaidik, Aparna (2021), Waiting for Swaraj: Inner Lives of
        Indian Revolutionaires, Cambridge University Press, pp. 121–122, ISBN
        978-1-00-903238-4, Despite it being a vengeful act, even Rajguru and
        Bhagat Singh were deeply disturbed and filled with remorse after
        shooting Saunders. Rajguru opined: "Bhai bada sundar naujawan tha
        [Saunders!]. Uske gharwalon ko kaisa lag raha hoga?' (Brother, he
        [Saunders] was a very handsome young man. How his family must be
        feeling?)! Similar was Bhagat's state. Mahour recounts that he met
        Bhagat after the Saunders murder and found him deeply shaken. 'Kitna
        udvelit tha unka manas. Unke sayant kanth se unka uddveg ubhara pada
        tha. Baat karte karte ruk jaate the aur der tak chup raha kar phir baat
        ka sutra pakad kar muskaraane ke prayatn karte aage badte the' (How
        shaken his mind was. Despite his measured tone his discomposure was
        visible. He would suddenly stop talking mid-sentence and then stay quiet
        for a while before making an effort to smile and move forward.)
